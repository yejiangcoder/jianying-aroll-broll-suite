# OpenAI Codex for Open Source Application Draft

## Project Summary

I maintain an open-source local automation suite for AI-assisted video editing workflows. The project helps creators working with Jianying / CapCut automate A-Roll editing workflows and B-Roll image alignment by combining draft inspection, safety gates, subtitle-aware planning, AI image matching, and editable timeline write workflows.

## Why This Project Is Open Source

Many creators repeat the same timeline operation dozens of times per video: match a line of narration, locate the correct subtitle start, insert an AI-generated B-roll image, and keep the clip editable. This project turns that workflow into a local, inspectable, scriptable open-source tool.

The project is useful for creators who want transparent local automation rather than opaque cloud editing pipelines.

## How Codex Is Used

I use Codex heavily for local Python tooling, draft file parsing, subtitle matching, test generation, documentation, release workflows, and maintaining the project. Access to ChatGPT Pro with Codex would directly support continued development, issue triage, documentation, and release automation.

## Future Development Needs

Codex would support:

- adding draft fixtures for more editor versions;
- improving the draft writer adapter;
- building safer validation before draft writes;
- expanding subtitle source support;
- generating regression tests;
- maintaining documentation and releases.

## Roadmap

- v0.1: clean OSS package, examples, tests, and draft JSON adapter.
- v0.2: additional draft fixtures and stronger validation.
- v0.3: optional OpenTimelineIO / XML export and release automation.

## Maintenance Workflows

Maintenance work includes parser fixes, fixture-driven adapter updates, issue triage, documentation updates, and small releases.

## Security / Privacy Statement

The project is local-first. It does not upload user media. The public repository contains fictional examples only and excludes runtime files, media assets, logs, local config, and credentials.
